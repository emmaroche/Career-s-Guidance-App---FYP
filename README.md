# Careers-Guidance-App-FYP

GitHub Repo for the Development of my iOS Mobile Application called 'The Careers Guidance App' for my Final Year Project.

## App Overview

The Careers Guidance App is a mobile application designed and developed for Apple iOS devices. It is designed to serve as a career guidance assistant for people in search of a third level undergraduate course in the Republic of Ireland. In order to help provide the user with the necessary information and support during their course search, the app includes a course matching questionnaire. Similar to a personality test, this questionnaire asks the user questions related to their interests and skills, both personal and academic. Once the user completes the questionnaire, course suggestions are generated that best match to their personality traits, skills and interests. The suggested courses are analysed based on the responses the user provided throughout the questionnaire.

## App Features

- Option to log in as an existing user, register as a new user or continue as a guest
- Course Matching Questionnaire (includes 20 questions with 6 answer options per question)
- Completed Questionnaire results can be saved and viewed again in the Results Dashboard
- In the Results Dashboard users can view an analysis of their top scoring category results, plotted on a pie chart (guest users are not permitted to use this feature)

## GitHub workflow

**The GitHub workflow illustrated below was used throughout development of this app:**

Issue - Branch - Commit(s) - Push - Pull Request - Merge - Close Issue (once full sprint was completed)

## User Interface

Screenshots for the completed app screens are provided below. The majority of the designs were similar to the Interactive Prototype created in semester one, which can be viewed here: [Careers Guidance iOS App Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/rgEVeHQKiUvBvZRrDRXuD6/FYP-UX-Design?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=8-184&viewport=-8%2C404%2C0.19&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=8%3A184)
